          Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the
          materials (information or software) on DEV Community's web site for
          personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of

          commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or
          non-commercial); attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software
          contained on DEV Community's web site; remove any copyright or other
          proprietary notations from the materials; or transfer the materials to
          another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server. This

          restrictions and may be terminated by DEV Community at any time. Upon
          terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of
          this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your

          Community makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby
          disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without
          limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
          fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual
          property or other violation of rights. Further, DEV Community does not
          warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely
          results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its Internet

          In no event shall DEV Community or its suppliers be liable for any
          damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or
          profit, or due to business interruption,) arising out of the use or
          inability to use the materials on DEV Community's Internet site, even
          if DEV Community or an authorized representative has been notified
          orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some
          jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or
          limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
          these limitations may not apply to you
