        <h2>Information Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with
          third parties for commercial purposes. We do share certain aggregated,
          non-personally identifying information with others about how our
          users, collectively, use DEV Community. For example, we may share
          information pertaining to the popularity of different programming
          languages for advertising partners. We do host first-party advertising
          on DEV Community. We do not run any code from advertisers and all ad
          images are hosted on managed DEV Community servers. For more details,
          see our section on Advertising Details. We may use User Personal
          Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have
          authorized. We may share User Personal Information with a limited
          number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide
          or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions
          similar to our own Privacy Statement. Our third party vendors are
          listed below.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text bold mt-5 mb-3">Third Party Vendors</h1>
        <h3>
          We may share your account information with third parties in some
          circumstances, including:
        </h3>
        <p>
          (1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets
          our data protection standards; (3) for survey or research purposes,
          after aggregation, anonymization, or pseudonymization; (4) when we
          have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a
          subpoena or other legal process; (5) when we have a good faith belief
          that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
          TalkWeb Community uses third-party vendors and hosting partners for
          hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we
          need to run DEV Community. By using DEV Community Services, you
          authorize DEV Community to transfer, store, and use your information
          in the United States and any other country where we operate. All
          service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our
          data protection standards.
        </p>
        <h2>Site monitoring</h2>
        <p>
          Talkweb Community uses a variety of third-party services to diagnose
          errors and improve the performance of our site. We aim to minimize the
          amount of personal information shared, but the information may include
          your IP address or other identifying information. All service
          providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data
          protection standards.
        </p>
        <h2>Payment processing</h2>
        <p>
          TalkWeb Community does not process payments directly — we rely on
          third-party services such as Stripe, Shopify, and Paypal to receive
          payments and store any payment information.
        </p>
        <h2>Third-Party Embeds</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the content that you see displayed on DEV Community is not
          hosted by DEV Community. These “embeds” are hosted by a third-party
          and embedded in DEV Community. For example: YouTube videos, Codepens,
          Twitter tweets, or GitHub code that appear within a DEV Community
          post. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were
          visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a DEV
          Community post page with a YouTube video embedded in it, YouTube
          receives data about your activity). DEV Community does not control
          what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they will
          do with it. Third-party embeds on DEV Community are not covered by
          this privacy policy; they are covered by the privacy policy of the
          third-party service. Be mindful when interacting with these services.
